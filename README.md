**CS171 Design Sprint Process Book**

## **PROJECT NAME: Invest Real Estate**

## **ABSTRACT:**

The team will design a web visualization project of 10-14 interactive slides which would provide our audience a deep understanding of the recent movement patterns in critical macroeconomic variables (e.g., inflation, interest rates, GDP) and how they are affecting the investment performance and growth outlook for four commercial real estate sectors (residential, industrial, office and retail).

## **MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Since the start of the global pandemic in early 2020, major macroeconomic movements have affected the global real estate economy in ways that would be evident and persistent for the next three to five years. Consider the volatility in residential asset prices as a result of falling and rising mortgage rates or the impact of hybrid work arrangements on the demand for office buildings. Multi-billion dollar real estate funds  devote a large part of their resources in researching and understanding these macroeconomic events to understand the effects on their portfolio as well as to allocate their buy and sell actions.

Our motivation to pursue this project stems from a desire and need to educate both technical and nontechnical audiences about where these markets have been and where they may be going. We plan to create a comprehensive set of easy-to-use advanced interactive web visualizations that will allow the user to understand the outcomes of these variables on four private equity real estate investment sectors.

We have also been able to procure a private equity companyâ€™s data that they are willing to let us use publically for our project. We will dedicate at least one full section of our visualization on presenting visualization as seen from the lens of a real private equity real estate fund.



1. **Target Audience - Knowledge and Interests:** Our target audience are real estate investors who would already understand the more nuanced variables and ideas that would be presented in this project. Their depth of knowledge and interest would accord with the advanced information served in this project.
