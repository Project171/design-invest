## **PROECT SUMMARY**

### **DESCRIPTION**

We have designed an interactive web visualization project to showcase aspects of Commercial Real Estate in Canada. Our primary target audience are real estate investors who understand the nuanced variables and ideas presented in this project. 


### **VISUALIZATIONS**

1. **MACROECONOMICS IN CANADA (Jessica Giochoco):** It highlights the recent movement patterns in critical macroeconomic variables:`Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in Canada, `unemployment rate`, `mortgage rates` and `consumer spending`. 

2. **INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE (Naina Garg):** It highlights the `capital value` invested across four major real estate sectors (**Industrial, Office, Retail, Residential**) and six major markets (**VECTOM: Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal**) and how each of these have performed in terms of `income return`, `capital growth` and `total return`.
   
3. **INDUSTRIAL SECTOR (Elizabeth Koch):** It highlights the impact of `vacancy rates` and `rent growth` in the Industrial sector across the six VECTOM markets as well as nationally.


### **RECOMMENDATION**

We recommend investing in the industrial real estate sector in Canada. Through a comprehensive set of innovative and intuitive web visualizations, we highlight the major macroeconomic movements in Canada, how commercial real estate  in Canada (across the four sectors and six markets) has performed during those economic troughs and peaks, and how one sector (INDUSTRIAL) has remained resilient producing high returns and net growth for investors.
