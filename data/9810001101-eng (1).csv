1,"<p><strong>Content considerations</strong></p><p>The 2021 Census population counts for a particular geographic area represent the number of Canadians whose usual place of residence is in that area, regardless of where they happened to be on Census Day. Also included are any Canadians who were staying in that area on Census Day and who had no usual place of residence elsewhere in Canada, as well as those considered to be 'non-permanent residents.' For most areas, there is little difference between the number of usual residents and the number of people staying in the area on Census Day. For certain places, however, such as tourist or vacation areas, or those including large work camps, the number of people staying in that area at any particular time could significantly exceed the number of usual residents shown here. The population counts include Canadians living in other countries, but do not include foreign residents living in Canada. Given these differences, users are advised not to interpret population counts as being the number of people living in the reported dwellings.</p><p>The dwelling counts refer to total private dwellings and private dwellings occupied by usual residents in Canada. The census dwelling counts do not include collective dwellings, which are dwellings of a commercial, institutional or communal nature. The usual residents in collective dwellings are, however, included in the population counts.</p><p>Changes occur to the names, boundaries and other characteristics of geographic areas (e.g., census subdivisions may amalgamate, or there may be an annexation or a change of name or status). Since the geographic framework is used for census data collection, the geographic reference date must be set several months before the date of the census in order to have these changes made in time. For the 2021 Census, the geographic reference date was January 1, 2021.</p><p>Land area is the area in square kilometres of the land-based portions of standard geographic areas. The data are unofficial, and are provided for the sole purpose of calculating population density. Land area data for the standard geographic areas reflect the boundaries in effect on January 1, 2021 (the geographic reference date for the 2021 Census of Canada).</p><p>Population centres are classified into three groups, depending on the size of their population:</p><ul><li>small population centres, with a population between 1,000 and 29,999</li><li>medium population centres, with a population between 30,000 and 99,999</li><li>large urban population centres, with a population of 100,000 or more.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> The ‘Geographic area type’ column in this table is presenting the population centre size groups and not the population centre type. Population centres can be classified as types such as ‘core’, ‘secondary core’ or ‘fringe’. The type indicates the relationship of the population centre to the census metropolitan area (CMA) or to the census agglomeration (CA) structure. This additional information may be found in other products such as GeoSuite.</p><p>Population is defined using population and population density data from the current census and is delineated using the dissemination block. The previous census counts provided in this table are the aggregation of the previous census population counts for the dissemination blocks that constitute the 2016 population centre.</p><p><strong>Definitions</strong></p><p>The Census Dictionary is a reference document which contains detailed definitions of Census of Population concepts, universes, variables, and geographic terms, as well as historical information.</p>"
